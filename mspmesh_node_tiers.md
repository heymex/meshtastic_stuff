In an effort to streamline communication and understanding, the following has been created to help us present a unified front when discussing mesh node layering.
This information comes from the All Client Test and will segue into Phase 2 of that test.
The ultimate goal is to help us better understand how a mesh of this size and coverage area behaves—and to provide better localized coverage while still increasing range.

Infrastructure
Qualifiers:
• Permanently installed
• High elevation (e.g., >100 ft above average terrain)
• Documented Line-of-Sight (LOS) to at least 1–2 other infrastructure nodes
• Primary role: rebroadcast/relay for large areas
• Static location, ideally solar or wired power
• Antenna should be outdoors
• Should be able to operate for a minimum of 7 days with no external charging input (low sun, no shore power, etc.)
• Include metadata: exact height, antenna gain/type, coverage map, and known LOS peers

Intermediate
Purpose: Bridge between infrastructure and local nodes
Qualifiers:
• Semi-permanent or fixed install
• Medium elevation (e.g., rooftop or mid-level buildings)
• LOS or strong signal path to infrastructure node
• Enhances connectivity in hard-to-reach areas or between clusters
• Acts as a “regional relay” for pocket and neighborhood nodes
• Antenna should be outdoors
• Should be able to operate for a minimum of 7 days with no external charging input (low sun, no shore power, etc.)

Neighborhood / HQ
Purpose: Anchor node for a local area or team
Qualifiers:
• Typically user homes, clubhouses, or semi-permanent locations
• Lower elevation but good coverage in the local community
• Connected to power and potentially other tech ( dashboard, etc.)
• May operate as a command/control or coordination node
• Can relay traffic up to intermediate or infrastructure
• Antenna should be outdoors
• Should be able to operate for a minimum of 7 days with no external charging input (low sun, no shore power, etc.) 

Mobile
Purpose: On-the-move communication and opportunistic relaying
Qualifiers:
• Installed in a vehicle, drone, or portable enclosure
• Operates intermittently or while in motion
• May serve as a relay in transit or tactical deployments
• No guarantee of persistent presence

Pocket
Purpose: Personal end-user devices
Qualifiers:
• Low power, battery-operated
• Typically handheld, wearable, or compact form factor
• No expectation of relaying other messages
• Used for direct communication, messaging, or alerts
As the All Client experiment continues, we will soon begin systematically switching devices over to Router Late to observe how this impacts both range and local network coverage.
Once the majority of this experiment is complete, we will provide guidance on node roles based on the criteria outlined above.
